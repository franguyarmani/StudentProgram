This program is the adaption of a program written in Lisp for an AI thesis in the 1960's. We have re-written the program in clojure, a more modern lisp dialect that runs on the JVM. The program accepts a path word problem, parses it and then solves it. Though it is not yet perfect, it does work on examples that do not require comma's to be parsed correctly.
